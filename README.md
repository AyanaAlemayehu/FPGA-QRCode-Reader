# Overview
This is our (Subhi and Ayana) 6.205 final project - a QR Code scanner implemented on an FPGA. Our scanner supports Version 1 QR Codes only that cannot be rotated (but can be translated from the center).

# Hardware Requirements
The only hardware requirements are a OV7670 camera module mounted onto a Seeeduino Xiao SAMD21 (with the camera arduino code included in the repository).

# Software Requirements
We output the decoded QR code through [manta](https://github.com/fischermoseley/manta)

# More Info
We have a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbPQgtRze6U) that gives a brief overview of how the system works, as well as a IEEE Formatted report included in the repository.
